# Weather App
As the title says, this is a basic weather app that I created in vanilla JavaScript. It is live [here](https://ajs-weather-app.netlify.app/).

## Components
- API: [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- Animated [Skycons](https://github.com/darkskyapp/skycons): I configured these to conditionally render based on the weather conditions at the user's location. 
- Date & time based on the users location 
- Clickable temperature that toggles between fahrenheit and celsius. 

Here's a quick demo of it in action showing various different locations:
